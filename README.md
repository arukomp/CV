# Arunas Skirius

A passionate and language agnostic _Junior Software Developer_. I've spent the better part of my life messing around with computers and code, and no matter how hard I tried to get away from it (with the means of music, photography, etc.), I'd always come back to coding. Wrote my first line of code at the age of 13 (Visual Basic), later created some PHP4/MySQL websites, done a lot of computer troubleshooting for myself and my friends and family. Of course, I broke loads of stuff as well... I blame curiosity.

A few years back I did a BSc Computing course at the University of Liverpool, but then had to leave a year later due to financial difficulties. That did not stop me from writing code. After a couple of years saving money, I decided to "go pro" and joined the Makers Academy to become an full-fledged Software Developer. Best decision ever.

## Skills

#### Software development
- **Languages/Technologies** - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, Java, PHP, Git, jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, XMPP, and more...
- **Fast learner** - Able to grasp new concepts and technologies really quickly. During the course at Makers Academy, I chose to do team projects in (at the time) unknown languages to boost my learning ability and explore other technologies/languages.
- **Debugging** - Able to follow to flow of the program, read the stack trace, hunt down and exterminate any bugs. A keen eye for typos, missing keywords, etc. Although my typing is pretty accurate and the number of typos is very minimal.
- **Researching** - I found that gazing at the screen doesn't do much, so I've befriended Google and StackOverflow to help me get through the "I don't know" phase. Able to research, read, and make sense of any documentation. If not, "we need to go deeper".
- **Quick to adapt** - Switching languages? Switching projects? No problem. I'm quick to adapt to new environments, both in programatic and real-life sense. I've lived in 4 different cities across Europe and written code in around 10 different programming languages.
- **Problem solving** - there's always a way.

#### Personal traits
- **Passionate** - I love learning, and I love developing software. I am fascinated by all things technology, and I know I will be developing software that will shape the future.
- **Humble** - In my humble opinion...
- **Patient** - So I've been told... Does not apply to slow technology (computer, internet connection, etc.)
- **Team worker** - Able to work in a team or alone. At Makers Academy, most of my time was spent pair-programming, of which 4 weeks were spent in a team environment where I'd develop software in teams of 4 people.
- **Communication** - Having pair-programmed for the duration of the Makers Academy course, I have learned to effectively communicate technical terms and ideas to my pair partner, as well as understanding the ideas being communicated to me.

## Project Highlights


| Name | Description | Team size | Technologies used
|:---:| --- |:---:| --- |
| **JabbyChat**<br> [GitHub (iOS)](https://github.com/WhatsApe/ios-client)<br> [GitHub (Web)](https://github.com/WhatsApe/web-client) | A free and very scalable messaging app, which uses the XMPP protocol and ejabberd server as a back-end for fast messaging. Our team collaboratively built both iOS and a Web clients in just 2 weeks. I mostly focused on the iOS client | 4 | XMPP, ejabberd, Swift, JavaScript, HTML, CSS |
| **Makers BnB**<br> [GitHub](https://github.com/jonnymoore12/Makers-BnB-Challenge)<br> [Live Demo](http://bnb-jesus.herokuapp.com/)| An AirBnB clone developed from scratch in 5 days. My first team based project, which involved learning loads about Git (PR, merging, reverting, etc). Used Waffle.io to help us manage tasks within the team | 4 | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML (erb), CSS, Bootstrap |
| **Simple Tests**<br> [GitHub](https://github.com/arukomp/simple-tests) | An example project extracted from my own coursework at Makers Academy, with the sole purpose to show how easy it is to create your own basic JavaScript testing framework (Jasmine-like). | 1 | JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS, HTML |

## Education
- **Makers Academy** _July - September 2016_ - an intensive 12 week bootcamp where I've learned:
  - **MVC**
  - **Agile** practices
  - **XP** values
  - **SOLID** principles
  - **TDD**
  - Loads about programming languages and **OOP**
  - and much much more...


- **University of Liverpool** _September 2011 - June 2012_ - BSc Computing
  - Java, relational databases (MySQL), UX/UI design, a bit of C and Assembly.

## Interests

- **Learning / Reading** - Love reading non-fiction in my spare time, anything to increase my knowledge so I can become better and contribute more to the world.

- **Music** - Attended a private music school between the age 9 and 16, where I learned to play piano and violin. Later self-taught to play guitar (acoustic and electric). I'm confident I can easily learn another instrument if I ever want to.

- **Photography** - Amateur. I do know the basics of photography and I own a basic DSLR (unless I sold it for food money by the time you read this ðŸ™ˆ ).

- **Travel** - Travelled to a bunch of countries so far, including Sweden, USA, Netherlands, Germany, etc. Looking forward to travel much more and hopefully see the whole world in my lifetime!

- **Sports** - Mostly exercising, staying fit and healthy. Healthy body -> healthy mind. Enough said.
