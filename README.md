# Arunas Skirius
> _Currently **open** to any opportunities_

A passionate and language agnostic _Software Developer_, advocate for lifelong learning and hard work. I've spent the better part of my life messing around with computers and code, and even if I'd go exploring different career paths (music, photography, retail), I'd always come back to coding. Wrote my first line of code at the age of 13 (Visual Basic), later created some PHP4/MySQL websites for about a year (made some money in the process), done a lot of computer troubleshooting for myself, friends and family. Of course, I broke loads of stuff as well... I blame curiosity.

A few years back I did a BSc Computing course at the University of Liverpool, but then had to leave a year later due to financial difficulties. That did not stop me from writing code. After a couple of years saving money, I decided to "go pro" and joined the Makers Academy to become an full-fledged Software Developer. Best decision ever.

Just a month later I got a job at a local car leasing company to develop and maintain one of their products, a website using ASP.Net Core, MSSQL and Angular for the front-end. Mind you, I had never laid my eyes on C# before this job, but they had faith in me, and in just a week or two I caught up to speed with the C# language and other tools/frameworks used by fellow developers, while still contributing bug fixes/refactoring on a daily basis from day one. A few weeks in I got to develop full features from the ground up.

My current job requires me to be involved in multiple different projects, ranging from customer facing e-commerce sites to internal systems (CRM, Stock Control), to integrating our existing systems with third-party tools to help automate the business. I use whichever tool gets the job done. I study it, I apply it, I improve it. Predominantly I use the Laravel 5 framework (PHP, MySQL). I have brought Agile tools to the team (CI, testing, issue boards, code reviews) to speed up and make the development less stressful and more organised.

## Skills

#### Software development
- **Languages/Technologies** - PHP, Laravel, C#, ASP.Net Core, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, Java, PHP, Git, jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, XMPP, and more...
- **Fast learner** - Able to grasp new concepts and technologies really quickly. During the course at Makers Academy, I chose to do team projects in (at the time) unknown languages to boost my learning ability and explore other technologies/languages. Got my first developer job to code in a language I've never touched before (C#).
- **Debugging** - Able to follow to flow of the program, read the stack trace, hunt down and exterminate any bugs. A keen eye for typos, missing keywords, etc. Although my typing is pretty accurate and the number of typos is very minimal.
- **Researching** - I found that gazing at the screen doesn't do much, so I've befriended Google and StackOverflow to help me get through the "I don't know" phase. Able to research, read, and make sense of any documentation. If not, I can always experiment in a REPL, "connect the dots" and make sense of how things work.
- **Quick to adapt** - Switching languages? Switching projects? No problem. I'm quick to adapt to new environments, both in programatic and real-life sense. I've lived in 4 different cities across Europe and written code in around 10 different programming languages.
- **Problem solving** - There's always a way. Pen & paper help me get through the initial phase of "where do I start??", domain modelling, user stories, etc.

#### Personal traits
- **Passionate** - I love learning, and I love developing software. I am fascinated by all things technology, and I know I will be developing software that will shape the future.
- **Humble** - In my humble opinion...
- **Patient** - So I've been told... Does not apply to slow technology (computer, internet connection, etc.)
- **Team worker** - Able to work in a team or alone. At Makers Academy, most of my time was spent pair-programming, of which 4 weeks were spent in a team environment where I'd develop software in teams of 4 people. On my first job I've worked in a much larger team, where communication was essential to delivering satisfactory results. Currently I work in a team of 3, where we all collaborate on everything from infrastructure design to the final code.
- **Communication** - Having pair-programmed for the duration of the Makers Academy course, I have learned to effectively communicate technical terms and ideas to my pair partner, as well as understanding the ideas being communicated to me.
